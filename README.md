# Notes on CryptoBall's Product Design

### What this repository is for?

Since our team decided to remain anonymous, communication became very critical to establish trust on our platform. So we wanted to be as open as possible about our decisions on design and development. This repository explains the rationale and thought processes behind development of CryptoBall, focusing specifically on UI/UX. It also serves as a starting point for our team to flesh out ideas for how our product should be. 

### Disclaimer

None of the material on this repository should be used as a reference, since the project is evolving all the time and some decisions might not be included in the notes provided here.
