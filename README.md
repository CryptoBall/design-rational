# Notes on CryptoBall's Product Design

### What this repository is for?

Since our team decided to remain anonymous, communication became very critical to establishing trust on our platform. So we wanted to be as open as possible about our decisions on design and development of the game. This repository explains the rationale and thought processes behind the design of CryptoBall, focusing specifically on UI/UX and functionalities of the client. It also serves as a starting point for our team to flesh out ideas for how our product should be and how we approach the development of the product as well.
