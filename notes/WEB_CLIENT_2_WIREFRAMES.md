# Web Client - Part 2

### Plan on Wireframes

Now that we have laid out the user stories, we have a general idea of what functionalities we should support in the web client. Moving forward, we will be drafting wireframes, a high-level overview of how our product should look and behave. The work here should serve as a guideline for creating high-fidelity UI afterward.

We want to create a UI that is clean and easy to understand. Inspired by trading terminals on crypto exchanges, our goal is to provide all the necessary information within one screen. This way new users will be able to quickly grasp what is going on and what they can achive with the platform at a single glance. Granted, it will be difficult to create such design without overly complicate the look of it, but careful use of space and typography should do us a merit here.

### Wireframe Results

### Next Steps

Some details were intentionally left out from the wireframe design. The higher fidelity mockup would provide more complete pictures for the end product. The next step we are going to do is to formalize all the details and starting the development of web client based on this wireframe and the upcoming mockups.
