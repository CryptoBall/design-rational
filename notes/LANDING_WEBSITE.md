# Landing Website

### Our Approach

Now that we have product specs ready and under production. The next thing to do is to start getting people to know about our creations and building a community around it. Like in any technology project, the first thing people will encounter and learn about the technology is the landing page. The landing page needs to illustrate the idea well enough to catch visitors' attention and make them wan to learn more about the project. Yet it needs to be concise and deliver accurate messages about our product as well. 

### What Should We Include in the Landing Page? 
Here are a few things that makes a great landing page, in our opinions:

- Provide overview of what the product is
  - One-sentence value proposition
  - Clear illustration to how the product works
- Provide links to the next things that visitors can follow on
  - Blog posts
  - Social media
  - Subscription option
- Provide common details visitors want to know
  - Roadmap/Timeline of product development

### MVP Version
We want to release the landing page as early as possible. So our first version of the landing page may not be perfect, and it will be improved once we have feedback from our community. Here is what the MVP version of the landing page looks like:
