# Logo

### Our Approach

Making good logo is hard. People only spend a split second looking at it, yet the logo needs to speak for the brand and product. What more? It has to be unique, attention-catching, and recognizable at the same time.

Like any design work, we approach making logo by defining the characteristics of it. Since CryptoBall offers **fun** and **enticing** experiences to the plyers, and at the same time being **modern** and **secure** with the utilization of Ethereum Network, we try to come up with different drafts of potential logos. One of the drafts that catches our attentions is:

Composed of 3 identical pieces working in unison, this logo looks circular, yet not just boring, plain, old circle. In our opinions, there certainly is a mysterious look to it. Although the lines are a little clunky and looked too bold for our tastes, we decide to move forward to further refine this draft.

### Result

After hours of shape and color adjustments, we finally achive the logo we'd like to go with. The circular shape with bumps resembles safe-locker wheel with handles. The lines leading to the middle are colored with lighter gradient, leading audience's eyes to the center. The slight angles of the lines create motion in the logo, make it as though it's spinning. With everything that's going on, there is still plenty of space inside the logo, making it a lot less clunky than the draft we had. Overall, we are very satisfied with the logo, and we hope our audiences will love it too.
