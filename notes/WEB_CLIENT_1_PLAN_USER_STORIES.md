# Web Client - Part 1

### Our Approach

Web client is the central part of user's interaction with CryptoBall. Its main goal is to provide a UI for the users to purchase a new tickets and cash-out rewards from the winning ones. It should also provide thorough instructions on how the users can accomplish common tasks and basic troubleshootings.

To help us visualize the common use cases of the web client more concretely, we'll be writing [User Stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story) in the next section. Then we'll use those stories as basis to designing the functionalities and UX of web client
